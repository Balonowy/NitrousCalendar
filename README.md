A simple calendar for laughing gas users.

## About the project

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Balonowy/NitrousCalendar/master/Assets/screenshot-en.PNG)

This small program allows me to keep track of my Nitrous Oxide usage. It reminds me about taking vitamin B12 and suggests pauses, when I overuse gas. I decided to publish it, so everyone can use it and contribute. How to use it?

#### Tabs and calendar
You can choose a different month by changing the selected tab. By default, the current month will be selected. Below tabs, you can see a button for every day from that selected month. Clicking the button will cause a context menu to pop-up. Use the menu items according to your B12/N2O use. Your choices will be stored in `Calendar.txt` file, which will be placed inside your current working directory.

#### Top right corner
Here you will see a small tip about you laughing gas use.

#### Run on startup
Ticking this checkbox will start the program every time you turn on your computer. Doing so will create a shortcut in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`. I recommend turning it on, because you will get the B12 reminder every time you start your PC. It does not change registry.

## Installation

It's pretty easy!

 1. Download and install [Microsoft .NET 5 Desktop runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
